Dear Class,

Quiz 3 will be a 105 minute timed at-home assessment administered through gradescope. The quiz will be available at 12 pm on Wednesday 4/20 and must be completed by 11:59 pm on Thursday 4/21.

Some specific topics that will be covered are:

    Bayesian Networks:
        Meaning of structure and parameters
        Conditional independence relationships
        Exact inference
        Inference via direct sampling
        Inference via likelihood weighted sampling
    Simple Games:
        Construction of simple games from a description
        Dominant strategies and dominant strategy equilibria
        Pure Nash equilibria
        Mixed Nash equilibria (you must understand the properties and be able to verify, but not find)
        Correlated Equilibria
    Sequential Games:
        Analysis of 2 player zero-sum 2-player games using minimax trees from section 5 of AIMA*
    Imitation and Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Basic Familiarity)
        Behavioral cloning
        DAgger
        SMILe
        Inverse Reinforcement Learning
        Maximum Margin Reinforcement Learning
        Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning
