# Quiz 2 Information

This information could receive minor updates as late as Monday, 4/12, so make sure to check back.

## Timing and Administration

The quiz will be administered on Gradescope and timed to 120 minutes, to be completed any time between noon on Tuesday 4/13 and 10pm on Wednesday 4/14.

## Content

The quiz will consist of 5 conceptual questions similar to the questions on the homework. No coding will be required, though **you will need a calculator or computer for a few calculations**. There are a couple problems that require hand-drawn figures. Please have the technology ready for that.

### Topics

- Multi-armed bandits
- Basic Reinforcement Learning Algorithms: Q-learning, SARSA, Policy Gradient, Max Likelihood Model-Based Reinforcement Learning, and basic variants
- Reinforcement Learning Terms: On/Off policy, Model-based/Model-free, etc.
- POMDP problem representation
- Alpha Vectors
- Policy Graphs
- Discrete Belief Updates
- Particle Filters (Rejection and likelihood-weighted)
- QMDP and Certainty-Equivalent approximations
- d-separation and conditional independence in Bayesian Networks
- Pure-strategy Nash equilibria in simple games

## Clarification Questions

I will be in my zoom room at the following times to answer clarification questions (you may want to plan your time to overlap with this):

1. 3-3:30 pm on 4/13
2. 6-6:30 pm on 4/13
3. 10-10:30 am on 4/14
4. 4-5 pm on 4/14

You may also post private questions on Piazza and I may answer them, but there are no guarantees.
