learning rate 0.0005 -> 0.001 - no meaningful difference
epsilon-decay 0.99 -> 0.95 - maybe too much decay
update_freq 100 -> 50 - potentially heled?
learning rate 0.001 -> 0.002 - couple very good episodes
update freq 50 -> 20 - no change still around -14
decay rate 0.98 -> 0.95 - potentially trending up?
decay rate 0.95 -> 0.94 - 
kearning rate 0.002 -> 0.005
0.005 -> 0.0035
batch size -> 128 - not much impact
